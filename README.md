This project aims to predict the success of SpaceX first stage landings using machine learning techniques. The landing success of the first stage is a critical factor in the reusability and cost-effectiveness of SpaceX rockets. By analyzing historical data and building a predictive model, we can gain insights into the factors that influence landing success and potentially forecast future outcomes.
This project also has an UI to interact with users for taking inputs. An wholesome project which has a web integration for machine learning model using flask.
